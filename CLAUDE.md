# CLAUDE.md — NetGains AI

## Project Overview

NetGains AI is a vertical AI fitness coaching app. It provides personalized workout tracking, nutrition logging, and an AI coach that knows the user's training history, goals, and preferences. The coach is the core product — it's what makes this different from a generic fitness tracker.

**Target user:** Intermediate lifters (18-30) who want data-driven coaching without paying for a human trainer.

**Core value prop:** The AI coach remembers everything — your PRs, your sticking points, your split, your macros. It gets smarter the more you use it.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes (serverless on Vercel)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + RLS)
- **AI:** Anthropic Claude API (Sonnet for everything — coach chat, onboarding parsing, daily brief)
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **PWA:** Progressive Web App (installable on mobile)

## Database Tables

- **profiles** — user info (height, weight, goal, training mode, coaching mode)
- **workouts** — workout sessions (date, notes, muscle group)
- **sets** — individual sets (exercise, weight, reps, variant: normal/warmup/drop/failure)
- **nutrition_logs** — logged meals (name, calories, protein, carbs, fat, date)
- **coach_memory** — persistent coach state (split_rotation, conversation_summary, onboarding data, food_staples)
- **chat_messages** — persisted chat messages for cross-device sync
- **exercise_library** — master list of exercises with muscle groups

## Architecture Decisions

### AI Architecture
- **All Sonnet, no Haiku** — Simplicity over micro-optimization. Onboarding is 7 messages per user, not worth the complexity of model routing.
- **tool_use for structured extraction** — Onboarding uses Sonnet with tool_use to extract structured data (name, age, height, weight, goal, etc.) from open-ended user responses. Guarantees correct types.
- **Dynamic system prompt:** ~800 tokens for onboarded users, ~1,500 for new users
- **Compact data formats:** Workouts sent as "Bench: 185x5, 185x5[drop]" not full JSON
- **Conversation memory:** After 10 messages, summarize chat into bullet points stored in coach_memory. New messages get summary + last 10 messages.
- **Response length:** Coach defaults to 2-3 sentences. Longer responses only for how/why questions, plans, or meal breakdowns.
- **15 message daily limit** per user

### Timezone Handling
- Client sends `localDate` with every message
- Server uses client date for all meal/workout queries
- Never rely on server time (Vercel runs in UTC)

### Set Variants
- Sets have a `variant` field: normal (default), warmup, drop, failure
- Warm-up sets are excluded from PR detection
- Drop sets are tagged so coach knows weight decrease was intentional
- Visual indicators: yellow left border for warmup, orange for failure

### Chat Persistence
- Messages stored in `chat_messages` table (not localStorage)
- Cross-device sync (Mac ↔ iPhone)
- Messages load from DB on component mount

### Coach Memory Keys
Special keys in `coach_memory` table:
- `name` — User's preferred name
- `age` — User's age (string)
- `training_split` — Human-readable split name (e.g., "PPL", "Upper/Lower")
- `split_rotation` — JSON array of workout days (e.g., `["Push", "Pull", "Legs", "Rest"]`)
- `injuries` — User's injuries/limitations (or "none")
- `food_staples` — JSON array of foods user always has on hand (e.g., `["whey protein", "eggs", "rice"]`)
- `conversation_summary` — Haiku-generated summary of older messages
- `summary_message_count` — Number of messages included in the summary

RLS policies: users can only access their own data

## Coding Conventions

- Use TypeScript strictly — no `any` types unless unavoidable
- Error handling on every Supabase query and API call
- Use `constants.ts` for AI models, token limits, rate limits — never hardcode
- Cleanup timeouts and listeners in useEffect return functions
- Use `formatLocalDate()` from `date-utils.ts` for all date operations
- Coach system prompt lives in `getSystemPrompt()` in `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`

## Onboarding (Simplified)

There is no separate onboarding flow. New users go directly to the coach chat.

### How it works
1. When a user has an empty profile (no height, weight, goal), the coach shows a hardcoded first message asking them to introduce themselves
2. User types whatever they want in the normal chat input
3. The chat API handles it with tool_use — coach uses `updateUserProfile` and `saveMemory` tools to save info
4. System prompt includes guidance to focus on collecting basics first before discussing nutrition/workouts

### Hardcoded first message (shown when profile is empty)
"hey, i'm your ai coach. i'll help you train smarter, eat right, and stay on track. tell me a bit about yourself — your age, height, weight, what you're training for, and what split you're running. throw in anything else you think i should know."

### Profile completeness check
Profile is considered "empty" if missing: `height_inches`, `weight_lbs`, or `goal`

### Service role client for profile updates
The `updateUserProfile` tool uses service role client to bypass RLS:
```typescript
const supabaseAdmin = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!
);
```

## Current State (Feb 21)

### What's Working
- **Workout logging** with set variants (warmup, drop, failure)
- **Nutrition logging** with calorie ring and macro tracking
- **AI coach chat** with persistent memory and cross-device sync
- **Dynamic Daily Brief** — Pre-workout/post-workout/rest day modes
- **PR detection** — Shared utility, excludes warmup sets
- **15 message daily limit** per user
- **Nuclear reset** via `/debug` page

### Beta Status
- Testing with dad & uncle
- Then 3-4 friends test for 3-5 days

## Phase 2 Roadmap (post-beta)

### 1. Claude Agent SDK Migration
Replace hand-built API route with the Agent SDK. Get built-in agent loop, tool execution, session management, and cost tracking. Less code to maintain, fewer bugs.

### 2. Subagent Architecture
Split the coach into specialists:
- **Main Coach** (Sonnet) — conversation, personality, user-facing responses
- **Nutrition Analyzer** (Haiku) — macro calculations, meal suggestions
- **Workout Analyzer** (Haiku) — volume analysis, plateau detection, progressive overload
- **Memory Summarizer** (Haiku) — already implemented, formalize as subagent
- **Daily Brief Generator** (Haiku) — daily training card and beat-this targets

### 3. Structured Output
Return JSON with explicit actions instead of parsing freeform text:
```json
{
  "response_text": "solid leg day...",
  "actions": [{ "type": "log_meal", "date": "2026-02-20", "meals": [...] }]
}
```

### 4. Hooks (Centralized Safety & Control)
- Pre-response: check daily message limit
- Pre-meal-log: validate macros are reasonable
- Pre-advice: add disclaimer if topic is medical
- Post-response: log token count and cost

### 5. MCP Integrations
- Apple HealthKit / Google Fit (steps, heart rate, sleep)
- MyFitnessPal (food logging, barcode scanning)
- Wearables (Oura, Whoop, Apple Watch)

### 6. React Native / Expo Migration
Move from PWA to native app for App Store. Unlocks push notifications, HealthKit, offline logging, camera for food photos.

### 7. Cost Architecture at Scale
- Target: under $0.10 per user session
- Per-user cost tracking in database
- Cache Daily Brief (don't regenerate on every tab open)
- RAG-style caching for generic fitness questions

### 8. Pricing Model (TBD after beta)
- Free tier: workout logging + basic stats (no AI coach)
- Paid tier: AI coach, nutrition tracking, personalized plans
