# CLAUDE.md — NetGains AI

## Project Overview

NetGains AI is a vertical AI fitness coaching app. It provides personalized workout tracking, nutrition logging, and an AI coach that knows the user's training history, goals, and preferences. The coach is the core product — it's what makes this different from a generic fitness tracker.

**Target user:** Intermediate lifters (18-30) who want data-driven coaching without paying for a human trainer.

**Core value prop:** The AI coach remembers everything — your PRs, your sticking points, your split, your macros. It gets smarter the more you use it.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes (serverless on Vercel)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + RLS)
- **AI:** Anthropic Claude API (Sonnet for coach chat, Haiku for background tasks)
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **PWA:** Progressive Web App (installable on mobile)

## Database Tables

- **profiles** — user info (height, weight, goal, training mode, coaching mode)
- **workouts** — workout sessions (date, notes, muscle group)
- **sets** — individual sets (exercise, weight, reps, variant: normal/warmup/drop/failure)
- **nutrition_logs** — logged meals (name, calories, protein, carbs, fat, date)
- **coach_memory** — persistent coach state (split_rotation, conversation_summary, onboarding data, food_staples)
- **chat_messages** — persisted chat messages for cross-device sync
- **exercise_library** — master list of exercises with muscle groups

## Architecture Decisions

### AI Cost Optimization (already implemented)
- **Dynamic system prompt:** ~800 tokens for onboarded users, ~1,500 for new users (down from ~2,500)
- **Compact data formats:** Workouts sent as "Bench: 185x5, 185x5[drop]" not full JSON
- **Conversation memory:** After 10 messages, Haiku summarizes chat into bullet points stored in coach_memory. New messages get summary + last 10 messages, not full history.
- **Model routing:** Sonnet for coach chat (personality matters), Haiku for Daily Brief, nutrition calculations, memory summarization
- **Response length:** Coach defaults to 2-3 sentences. Longer responses only for how/why questions, plans, or meal breakdowns.
- **15 message daily limit** per user

### Timezone Handling
- Client sends `localDate` with every message
- Server uses client date for all meal/workout queries
- Never rely on server time (Vercel runs in UTC)

### Set Variants
- Sets have a `variant` field: normal (default), warmup, drop, failure
- Warm-up sets are excluded from PR detection
- Drop sets are tagged so coach knows weight decrease was intentional
- Visual indicators: yellow left border for warmup, orange for failure

### Chat Persistence
- Messages stored in `chat_messages` table (not localStorage)
- Cross-device sync (Mac ↔ iPhone)
- Messages load from DB on component mount

### Coach Memory Keys
Special keys in `coach_memory` table:
- `food_staples` — JSON array of foods user always has on hand (e.g., `["whey protein", "eggs", "rice"]`)
- `split_rotation` — JSON array of workout days (e.g., `["Push", "Pull", "Legs", "Rest"]`)
- `conversation_summary` — Haiku-generated summary of older messages
- `summary_message_count` — Number of messages included in the summary
- RLS policies: users can only access their own messages

## Coding Conventions

- Use TypeScript strictly — no `any` types unless unavoidable
- Error handling on every Supabase query and API call
- Use `constants.ts` for AI models, token limits, rate limits — never hardcode
- Cleanup timeouts and listeners in useEffect return functions
- Use `formatLocalDate()` from `date-utils.ts` for all date operations
- Coach system prompt lives in `getSystemPrompt()` in `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`

## Current State (February 2026)

### Working
- Full onboarding flow (coach interview + split selection)
- Workout logging with set variants (warmup, drop, failure)
- Nutrition logging with calorie ring and macro tracking
- AI coach with persistent memory and cross-device sync
- Daily Brief with "beat this" targets matching training day
- Markdown rendering in coach messages
- 15 message daily limit
- Beta welcome message after onboarding

### Known Issues
- Date separator occasionally shows "Wednesday, Dec 31" (null timestamp fallback)
- Superset support not yet implemented (requires linking exercises)

### Beta Status
- Testing personally for a few days
- Then dad & uncle test
- Then 3-4 friends test for 3-5 days
- Collecting feedback to guide Phase 2

## Phase 2 Roadmap (post-beta)

### 1. Claude Agent SDK Migration
Replace hand-built API route with the Agent SDK. Get built-in agent loop, tool execution, session management, and cost tracking. Less code to maintain, fewer bugs.

### 2. Subagent Architecture
Split the coach into specialists:
- **Main Coach** (Sonnet) — conversation, personality, user-facing responses
- **Nutrition Analyzer** (Haiku) — macro calculations, meal suggestions
- **Workout Analyzer** (Haiku) — volume analysis, plateau detection, progressive overload
- **Memory Summarizer** (Haiku) — already implemented, formalize as subagent
- **Daily Brief Generator** (Haiku) — daily training card and beat-this targets

### 3. Structured Output
Return JSON with explicit actions instead of parsing freeform text:
```json
{
  "response_text": "solid leg day...",
  "actions": [{ "type": "log_meal", "date": "2026-02-20", "meals": [...] }]
}
```

### 4. Hooks (Centralized Safety & Control)
- Pre-response: check daily message limit
- Pre-meal-log: validate macros are reasonable
- Pre-advice: add disclaimer if topic is medical
- Post-response: log token count and cost

### 5. MCP Integrations
- Apple HealthKit / Google Fit (steps, heart rate, sleep)
- MyFitnessPal (food logging, barcode scanning)
- Wearables (Oura, Whoop, Apple Watch)

### 6. React Native / Expo Migration
Move from PWA to native app for App Store. Unlocks push notifications, HealthKit, offline logging, camera for food photos.

### 7. Cost Architecture at Scale
- Target: under $0.10 per user session
- Per-user cost tracking in database
- Cache Daily Brief (don't regenerate on every tab open)
- RAG-style caching for generic fitness questions

### 8. Pricing Model (TBD after beta)
- Free tier: workout logging + basic stats (no AI coach)
- Paid tier: AI coach, nutrition tracking, personalized plans
